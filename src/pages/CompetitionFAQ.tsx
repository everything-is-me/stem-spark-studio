          question: "Is there a deadline for registration?",

        },
        {
          question: "Can I participate in multiple categories?",

        },
        {
          question: "What happens if my project doesn't win?",

        {
          question: "How long should my project be?",
          answer: "Most projects take 3-6 months of development. The research and development phase is followed by documentation and presentation preparation."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need expensive equipment?",
          answer: "No! Many winning projects use simple, locally available materials. We encourage innovative use of affordable materials. Budget constraints should not limit participation."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I use online resources and AI tools?",
          answer: "Online research is encouraged, but the core innovation and execution must be your own work. AI can be used as a tool, but not to generate your entire project idea or implementation."
